# SentinelOps – AI-Powered Self-Healing Linux System

## Overview
SentinelOps is a lightweight, AI-augmented Linux agent that provides real-time self-healing, anomaly detection, Slack alerting, and OpenRouter-powered GPT explanations. It's designed for personal systems, DevOps environments, and small-scale production use.

---

## Features
- Disk usage monitoring and auto-log cleanup
- Memory spike detection and safe process killing
- Service health checks and auto-restart (e.g., cron, nginx)
- Slack webhook integration for alerts
- OpenRouter GPT integration for log explanations
- Anomaly detection with Python + psutil
- Prometheus + Grafana dashboard support
- Fully automated via `systemd` timers

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentinelops-self-healing-linux-agent.git
cd sentinelops-self-healing-linux-agent
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

---

## Configuration
Edit `/etc/sentinelops/agent.conf` to adjust:
- `DISK_USAGE_LIMIT`
- `MEMORY_THRESHOLD`
- `SERVICE_NAME`
- `ENABLE_SLACK`, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
- `EXPLAIN_LOGS`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

---

## How It Works
- Every 5 minutes, systemd runs `sentinel.sh` and `sentinel-metrics.py`
- These agents check for disk/memory/service anomalies
- Auto-remediation occurs based on config
- Alerts and explanations are sent to Slack and logs

---

## Monitoring Dashboard (Optional)
- Node Exporter runs on `:9100`
- Prometheus scrapes metrics
- Grafana visualizes data using provided dashboard JSON

---

## Requirements
- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian preferred)
- Python3, psutil, jq
- Internet for OpenRouter + Slack (optional)
